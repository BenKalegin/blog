<p class="good">Superb! Media Player used to run minimised in the background --
NOT ANYMORE! Should come with Media Player as standard. Really funny.
<span class="person">Martin Glen</span>.</p>

<p class="bad">This has got to be <b>the</b> worst use of code there ever was.
It is so stupid, it defies the imagination...
not to mention the <b>intellengence</b>.
If this is all you can put your <b>tallents</b> into,
then you ought to find something else to do...
like be a mine sweeper or something.
No creativity, no imagination, no plot, no nothing.
Jeesh... if this is what you learned in software school, you wasted your money.

It's simple, I like that, and it actually seems to follow the music,
an issue with just about every visualization I've ever seen.

<p class="good">My favourite visualizations! 
With so many different sticks available for download and
the ability to easily create your own there are just so many different
things to chose from...this really is a great thing in the somewhat
barren visualization field.

And you have it down pat. Keep up the good work.

sheer genius and one of the best sites for wmp visulations.
Hail Lucian! Master of the sticks!

I sat for hours playing without even feeling it.
